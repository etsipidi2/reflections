When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To be able to share my code with others and to be able to work on it even when lacking
access to my personal computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

For consistency of logical units and for working on code without interruptions from
new code arriving.
