When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To be able to share my code with others and to be able to work on it even when lacking
access to my personal computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

For consistency of logical units and for working on code without interruptions from
new code arriving.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are clones that happen on GitHub servers - usually for working on a repository you don't have
permission to change. Clones are copies of repositories including their complete histories. Branches
are different versions of repositories.
