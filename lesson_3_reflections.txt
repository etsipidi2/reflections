When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To be able to share my code with others and to be able to work on it even when lacking
access to my personal computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

For consistency of logical units and for working on code without interruptions from
new code arriving.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are clones that happen on GitHub servers - usually for working on a repository you don't have
permission to change. Clones are copies of repositories including their complete histories. Branches
are different versions of repositories.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Being able to compare it with your local changes.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Would probably use something like Google Docs - its learning curve is easier, but it does not have
the level of support of Git & GitHub.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? 
What benefits does each approach have?

Cleaner and easier to see the changes. Also, gives them a meaningful name as opposed to working 
directly on master.
